# VLM Research Image Generator
A web application for generating clean images from text captions using Stable Diffusion, designed for academic research on Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

## Overview
This project provides a tool for generating images from text captions using Stable Diffusion, specifically for educational research on trustworthy machine learning. The generated images can be used to test attack models on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and study adversarial examples and defense mechanisms.

The application consists of:

1. Frontend: A Next.js web application with a clean, user-friendly interface.
2. Backend API: A Flask server running on Google Colab that processes image generation requests.
3. Image Generation: Stable Diffusion model for high-quality image generation from text captions.
